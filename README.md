# Insider-Trail-Project
Cricket League Simulation Project In Laravel

Just Copy The .env zip  File Into Your Local Machine Server
Please Set Your Database Connection In The .env File
Please Run The Command
php artisan migrate

that's set

this project still needs some work to complete, but the time given by insider finished. The database structure is fully completed, I mean no changes will occur in database. The problem is just showing the result in the UI but the time did not give permission.
